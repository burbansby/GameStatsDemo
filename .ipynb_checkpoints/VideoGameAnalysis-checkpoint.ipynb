    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "The video game industry is one of the fastest growing forms of entertainment out there right now. Hundreds of new games are released every year all with different styles across multiple platforms. Some games are absolute masterpieces and loved by millions, while others get no attention at all. All developers have the same thought on their mind: \"How can I make the best game possible?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will collect data about video games past, and see how we can use developer's decisions before us, to give reasoning to how their games performed. If we can develop a strong relationship between developer decisions and game performance, we will be able to accurately predict how future games will perform before they are even released. We can use this knowlege as developers to design a game with the highest probability of success.\n",

    "This data is rounded up from a csv file that can be found <a href = \"https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/video_games/\">here</a>. This dataset provides information for over a thousand games released from 2004 to 2008. Unfortunately that 5 year range was 12-16 years ago from today, so it may be difficult to base decions for the future off 12 year old data, but it can still provide valuable information. This data also does not include PC releases for games so we will only be exploring from a console development perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to is import the data into a Pandas dataframe. After that we can clean up the table to only provide the information that we need. We will also generalize the platform of the game's release to the console's parent company. This is because current games are very rarely produced for any of the consoles listed in the table, however these companies still have the leading consoles on the market today\n",
    "\n",
    "***Games with multiple genres and platform releases will be duplicated so that they can be applied to multiple categories. For example, a 2 genre game on 2 platforms will appear 4 total times so that all platform and genre combinations appear "

Since release year is not really a controllable factor other than delaying or rushing a game's development we will use that for something a little later and focus on the other 3. The remaining 3 metrics are the dependant variables in this situation. These are statistics based on how players reacted to the game. They can not be controlled by the developers, but understanding how to improve them is crucial to game development. A developer's end goal is to produce a game with the highest critic score, sales numbers, and player involvement as possible.   \n",

To do this we need to analyze the 3 independant variables one at a time. We can separate the data by the independent variable we want to focus on, then make a boxplot for how the games categories perform. We can start by separating the games by platform, and making 3 separate boxplots to measure how each of ther performance metrics change."

    "These results are much different from the results we saw based entirely on the 2004-2008 averages. Group games appear to still be the highest scoring games, but now the top spot goes to racing/driving games on the playstation. This shows just how important it is to not only look at statistics, but also analyze trendlines and make predictions. Just by looking at the averages we thought the best game to make was a simulation game on the xbox, but the trendlines showed that both that genre and platform we not gaining popularity anywhere near the rate of others. You can use this type of analysis to stay ahead of the competition and create games designed to have a successful future, rather than pander to what is popular at the moment.\n",

    "This chart verifies that our prediction of increasing Playstation popularity was not just a 5 year fluke.

    "So now you are equipped with the tools you need to predict game success. You can go back through and replicate this tutorial on your own if you wish to make modifications based on prsonal ideas. You can change the weights of the ranking system to lean heavier on the metrics you feel are more important. You can also run the predictive bar graphs on years other than 2020, so if a game is going to take you a few years to make you know what the market will be like on release. You can also import more recent data (as long as it contains the same information we used) in order to make a more up to date trendline. It is up to you to design the best game possible and you have all the data right here to do it.  "
